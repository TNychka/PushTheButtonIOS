# Push the Button IOS

### WIP

Do you ever find yourself really wanting to push a button? Do you want to take care of a child without actually dealing with all that human interaction? Then Button Press is for you! Take care of your new button child by pushing it. Most of the time when you push someone's buttons it's a bad thing, but in this case it will make the button that much happier! Don't let your button reach zero happiness though because if it does it will explode, then die. Or die and explode... the point is you don't want that to happen. Have fun!
